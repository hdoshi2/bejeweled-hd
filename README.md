# Bejeweled

-The primary goal is to implement a rendering of the grid portion of the bejeweled game.
-When rendered, the solution should display the grid, and there should be an easy way (eg, refresh the
page, click a “new grid button”) to generate a new grid.
-The grid should have cells of 7 different colors.
